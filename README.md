# The Be Student project

A project promoting better communication between universities and prospective students in Bulgaria!

There are many questions before every prospective student that have to be answered: What shall I study? Where and how may apply for a particular course? What is the difference in that course of study between University 1 and University 2? We are trying to help every student find the answers a little bit more easily. Our project aims at gathering all information in one place so that everyone can find his way through the jungle of information.

We hope that many would benefit from the further developement of the project.
